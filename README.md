# Multidimensional segment tree

The repo contains a 2d segment tree that can do range updates and range queries in polylogarithmic time (O(log(n) log(m))

This is a partially rewritten version of [nibtehaz/Multidimensional-Segment-Tree](https://github.com/nibtehaz/Multidimensional-Segment-Tree). In particular it no longer relies on floating point division, so results should be exact.
